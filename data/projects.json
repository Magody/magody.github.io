Unlike traditional chatbots or instruction-tuned assistants, MirAI is powered by a base LLaMA 3.2 model fine-tuned using QLoRA via the Unsloth framework. The model is trained without pre-aligned conversational headers, enabling a freer and more stylized response generation.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li><strong>Custom Prompt Templates</strong>: Designed for base-style training, enabling creative and unpredictable responses.</li><li><strong>QLoRA Fine-Tuning</strong>: Lightweight adaptation using LoRA with Unsloth, optimized for systems with 12GB VRAM.</li><li><strong>Real-Time Inference</strong>: Uses <code>FastLanguageModel</code> with streaming generation to power live VTuber conversations.</li><li><strong>Fully Modular Architecture</strong>: Divided into config, model manager, and dataset transformer modules for flexibility and reuse.</li><li><strong>Base Model Behavioral Shaping</strong>: Carefully constructed dataset and prompt engineering to simulate memory, reflexivity, and improvisation.</li></ul><h3>Model Training Strategy</h3><p>MirAI is built on a <strong>base-style LLaMA 3.2 model</strong>, trained using SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) without headers like <code>&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;</code>. This allows more creative control and personalization but requires careful dataset formatting and iterative tuning to stabilize behavior.</p><ul><li><strong>Training Style:</strong> base</li><li><strong>LoRA Targets:</strong> q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, o_proj, gate_proj, up_proj, down_proj</li><li><strong>Precision:</strong> bfloat16 with quantization for 4-bit inference</li><li><strong>Headers:</strong> Custom prompt-based formatting (no instruction/response markup)</li></ul><h3>VTuber Integration</h3><p>MirAI uses a minimal desktop UI or OBS layer and syncs model output with an animated character avatar using <strong>VTube Studio</strong>. The system captures voice or text input, runs it through the model, and animates the avatar’s expressions accordingly.</p><h3>Challenges & Resolutions</h3><ul><li><strong>Base Model Confusion:</strong> Initially struggled with maintaining consistent dialogue roles. Resolved with progressive training using masked templates.</li><li><strong>VRAM Limitations:</strong> Applied CPU offload and 4-bit quantization to support RTX 3060.</li><li><strong>Response Quality:</strong> Improved via prompt restructuring and behavioral refinement (e.g., sarcasm, identity).</li></ul><h3>Demo Video</h3><p>Watch MirAI come to life:</p><div style='padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;'><iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/1068670869?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;' title='Vtuber-Demo'></iframe></div><script src='https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js'></script><h3>Future Plans</h3><ul><li>Integrate memory modules using a vector DB for long-term context retention.</li><li>Enable real-time voice recognition and speech synthesis (e.g., Whisper + ElevenLabs).</li><li>Refactor model with GRPO for alignment to emotional tone and stream interactivity.</li><li>Deploy on Twitch or YouTube Live with OBS overlays.</li></ul><h3>Takeaway</h3><p>MirAI is a step toward immersive, reflexive AI characters that blend language understanding with emotional nuance.

    "process_html": "<h2>Gesture Recognition Using Android</h2><p>The project consists of recognizing gestures made with the cell phone, using the phone's accelerometer and gyroscope to predict a custom type of movement that was previously trained and send that prediction to a server. The server then draws symbols on the screen according to the gesture predicted by the network. This is a small step toward saving any type of gesture in the future and using the cell phone as an augmented reality controller in applications or video games on the web.</p><div><img src='/images/projects/machine_learning/AndroidGestureRecognition/0.png' alt='Overview of gesture recognition' style='max-width: 100%;'></div><p>Through the movement of the hand with the cell phone, the sensors collect data, and this data is used to train a feedforward neural network.</p><div><img src='/images/projects/machine_learning/AndroidGestureRecognition/1.png' alt='Training process overview' style='max-width: 100%;'></div><p>The system has a CRUD of operations for managing gestures and other user information. For training, at least 10 repetitions must be stored for each gesture. From these examples, another 200 are generated using data augmentation. Several mathematical operations are applied to the data to generate new data while preserving the main essence of the gestures.</p><div><img src='/images/projects/machine_learning/AndroidGestureRecognition/2.png' alt='Data augmentation' style='max-width: 100%;'></div><p>The system also has a data management panel created using Angular.</p><div><img src='/images/projects/machine_learning/AndroidGestureRecognition/3.png' alt='Angular management panel' style='max-width: 100%;'></div><p>The neural network receives an input of 600 variables: 100 data points for each axis and for each type of sensor (Gyroscope and Accelerometer). Based on this input, it predicts the type of gesture. The application connects to a server to communicate its prediction, which then draws an arrow on the screen for a lateral movement or a cross for a shooting movement. These were the two main types of gestures the network was trained with.</p><div><img src='/images/projects/machine_learning/AndroidGestureRecognition/4.png' alt='Server-based gesture predictions' style='max-width: 100%;'><img src='/images/projects/machine_learning/AndroidGestureRecognition/5.png' alt='Gesture recognition example' style='max-width: 100%;'></div><p>Few epochs and a learning rate of 0.01 were used for training, with 600 input neurons, 35 neurons in the first hidden layer, 18 neurons in the second hidden layer, and N neurons in the output layer (N depends on the number of gestures saved by the user). As a conclusion, a hit rate of 80% was obtained. The neural network struggled to recognize gesture types when the device was used in streaming mode (live), but in static predictions, where gestures were saved and then sent for prediction, the network performed correctly. For better signal handling, it is recommended to use convolutional or recurrent neural networks to achieve higher accuracy scores.</p>"

He remembers many of the customs of a planet called Earth and that he comes from there. He learned to communicate with the villagers and they welcomed him as one of their own. As he conversed more fluently with the leaders, he learned that the planet is going through a crisis in which many plagues of monsters fall from meteorites and torment the people. Gradually, they were cornered in \"protected\" sectors like the valley where he woke up.</p><p>The richest people enjoy abundant magical power that allows them to establish barriers in their cities to protect themselves from the monsters. However, Adodot Valley has only poor people who try not to get involved in the war. Hyul helped where he could in exchange for food and other necessities. The town was surrounded by huge mountains and the only exits contained hundreds of monsters. Many village heroes tried to break through but failed.</p><p>As people moved from place to place, they took common goods, ornaments, and pets but left behind books of knowledge. The passing of decades caused humanity on that planet to forget their history, being governed only by what the king of the day said through well-trained magician messengers who appeared not to protect but to collect resources. Currently, there are only five old sages with the knowledge to heal, destroy, and create scattered around the world.</p><p>Hyul will seek every way to help Adodot Valley, gathering as much knowledge as possible to face first the monsters, then the noble classes while seeking the reason for his appearance on that planet and the origin of the monster meteorites.</p>",
